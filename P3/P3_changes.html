        <h1>Changes that we made</h1>
        <h2>individualWatches.html</h2>
        <p>I (henrik) worked with individualWatches.html. The descriptions that were made in p2 were mostly visual, and as such I have taken a few liberties when it comes to function. We have several "products" and as such i wanted to consolidate all the different products into only individualWatches.html. This was achived through just adding a line to the url (in our case product1-6 and make the website display different pictures, prices, names and descriptions accordingly.) as for the styling, i did not follow the size requierments that were specified for the images because i thought it was too big and looked ugly. Also i made the link change depending on the url so that the price in checkout can be changed by reusing the same code.</p>
        <h2>universal.js</h2>
        <p> I (henrik) just made the navbar and footer into a variable and innerHTMLed it to all the websites.</p>

        <h2>Changes in universal layout</h2>
        <p>I (Ludvig) made a few visual changes to the header, like removing the underline, and changing all the font sizes to vw to be more fluid. Becoming bold, and changing color didn't look very good either, so instead, I made a function in javascript called applyScaleEffect. This function scales all sitelinks to 10% of it's original style. I also applied a transition effect to make it look more smoothly.</p>
            <p>When the window size goes to a ipad window size or smaller, the horisontal page links changes to a button, that when hovered, will show the page links as a dropdown menu. Used @media (max-width: 768px) for this, and we used this media querie as the default when styling all the other pages as well.</p>
        <p>We were supposed to have the current page you were visiting scale by 10%, but we removed this feature as it didn't feel as responsive as we thought it would be.</p>
            <h2>Changes to frontpage.html</h2>
            <p>The frontpage looks pretty much the same as it was supposed to, except from making the div boxes that each watch is to be displayed wider. I also made a media querie so that each box is displayed on top of each other, with the same margin on all sides.</p>
