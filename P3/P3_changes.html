        <h1>Changes that we made</h1>
        <p>git pu</p>
        <h2>individualWatches.html</h2>
        <p>I (henrik) worked with individualWatches.html. The descriptions that were made in p2 were mostly visual, and as such I have taken a few liberties when it comes to function. We have several "products" and as such i wanted to consolidate all the different products into only individualWatches.html. This was achived through just adding a line to the url (in our case product1-6 and make the website display different pictures, prices, names and descriptions accordingly.) as for the styling, i did not follow the size requierments that were specified for the images because i thought it was too big and looked ugly. Also i made the link change depending on the url so that the price in checkout can be changed by reusing the same code.</p>
        <h2>universal.js</h2>
        <p> I (henrik) just made the navbar and footer into a variable and innerHTMLed it to all the websites.</p>
        <h2>contact.html</h2>
        <p> The main changes to this website is in the information in the box off to the right of the form. The information is the same, but the styling of the information is not. "Contact" has been pushed beneath "Watch me Trade" instead of to the right of it </p>
        <p> The submit button has also not been styled the exact same way as in the mockup, but it is mostly identical</p>
        <p> For the mobile version, I decided to push the information down beneath the form instead of to the right, and have the user scroll down for the information instead.</p>
        <h2>error.html</h2>
        <p> This has just been styled to be more appealing to look at. We made the message into two sentences to seem more apologetic</p>
