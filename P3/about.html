        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <h3>We are a global industry providing safe trading of wristwatches.</h3>
        <img src="img/ab1.img" id="ab1">
        <p class>This company's values are based around our core principles.
            The first principle we follow holds our main motivation.
            As the wristwatch industry has a growing community, it is necessary for a safe method of watch trading.
            This safety is the key to enjoy the expensive hobby that wristwatch enthusiasts take part into its full extent.
            Our second principle holds the legitimacy of the watches for sale. We always closely study submitted watches, therefore scams rarely occur.
            Since the payment goes through our company, a newly bought watch can be returned and fully refunded if the pictures are not on par with the pictures.<br /><br />
            <img src="img/safety.img" id="safety"> </br>
            Being a part of several wristwatch communities, the main problem surrounding watch trading includes being scammed, and watches being stolen before any payment is submitted.
            This website's purpose serves to fulfill a solution to these problems.
            Our employees have a history in watch trading, and any question submitted can be fully answered from our rich history of experience.
            The employees' motivation strives from also being able to use the website themselves, and thus further motivates us to provide a safe environment.
