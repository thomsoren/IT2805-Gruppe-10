        <h3>Our Client</h3>
        <p>Our client is an imaginary watch trader, who requests a website where you can easily trade watches. He
            already owns a store “Watch Me Trade” where he buys and trades watches, and now he is looking to increase
            his sales by expand to the web.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Web site’s purpose and goals</h3>
        <p>What is the motivation for the target group to visit the website?</p>
        <ul>
            <ls>Trade watches easily</ls>
            <ls>Secure trading</ls>
        </ul>
        <p>The purpose of the website is for enthusiasts who wish to safely sell, buy and distribute luxury watches. It
            should ensure the customers safety as well as guarantee the customer a easy and intuitive purchase and/or
            selling process. The imaginary owner of the website is a watch trader, and is requesting a website to sell
            and buy watches more easily. The webpage therefore needs to make it easy to buy, and easy to request an
            offer for your own luxury watch.

            There can be big difference in age between the users. The website should be able to cater to all ages who
            visit the website. To achieve this, the website must be easy to use and organized with an intuitive and
            functional design.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            Watch enthusiasts of all ages who would like to see what’s on the market. Both people who can afford luxury
            watches, and people who might be interested in selling them. We will also be adding links with more
            information about the watches in question, so people can learn as much as they want about a specific watch.
            This will hopefully lead to an audience for generally learning about watches as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Content of the website and organization</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Front page</li>
            <p>The front page will display in-stock watches that the user can buy, and there should be a visible
                link to a different page that lets you fill out a form to request an offer for your own luxury
                watch. As per requested, the top of the home page will contain a “home”, “sell”, “buy”, “about us”
                and “contact” button.</p>
            <li>Watches that you can buy</li>
            <p>Here you can see an overview of all watches for sale. Here you can also filter through watches by date
                added, price, in-stock, out-of-stock and brand. Information about each watch must be present, and a link
                to more details about the specific watch model.</p>
            <li>Page to sell your own watch</li>
            <p>This page has a form that the user will fill which includes details about the watch they are trying to
                sell. This form will include a picture of said watch, price, description of the watch and information
                about the seller. Preferably they will be redirected to a loading page which tells them the watch is in
                good enough condition, as well as have enough photos to be sold.</p>
            <li>Specific watches</li>
            <p>Here the information about individual watches that the seller specified is displayed. This page should
                have a “checkout” button which takes the user to a checkout site. This page should also give the user
                the ability to view the sellers information. E.g. user reviews and history.</p>
            <li>Checkout</li>
            <p>This section should include a form where card information needs to be filled out. This should be straight
                forward with a button at the end of payment which takes the user back to the front page or a “watch
                successfully bought” page. Maybe with some confetti or specific CSS styling.</p>
            <li>Sorry, this function is currently not available</li>
            <p>The customer will be redirected to this page if they try to proceed from checkout. In this project we
                have some limitations. More about when this will occur is described in the “technical difficulties”
                part.</p>
            <li>About us</li>
            <p>This section tells the story about how the clock trading company came to be, and some background-info
                about our client. The contents must be believable and authentic information which lets the user feel a
                sense of security through the clients pathos.</p>
