            should ensure the customers safety as well as guarantee the customer a easy and intuitive purchase and/or
            selling process. The imaginary owner of the website is a watch trader, and is requesting a website to sell
            and buy watches more easily. The webpage therefore needs to make it easy to buy, and easy to request an
            offer for your own luxury watch.

            There can be big difference in age between the users. The website should be able to cater to all ages who
            visit the website. To achieve this, the website must be easy to use and organized with an intuitive and

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            Watch enthusiasts of all ages who would like to see what’s on the market. Both people who can afford luxury
            watches, and people who might be interested in selling them. We will also be adding links with more
            information about the watches in question, so people can learn as much as they want about a specific watch.
            This will hopefully lead to an audience for generally learning about watches as well.
