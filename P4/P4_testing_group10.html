      <h1>Feedback summary:</h1>
      <p>
          One of the most common feedback that we received about the website was that it was easy to understand 
          and navigate with little to no issues. Although there were no dire issue, there were some comments about 
          what the website was lacking. Some found it not to be so pleasing to look at with a interaction design 
          student thinking we should have taken the WCAG-convention more into consideration when designing the 
          website. Some wished there was a functionality for a search function on the buy site as well as a sort 
          function so the user could sort by price and or model. Other quality of life changes would be making the 
          logo and mail icon clickable so that the user can easily return to the home page and to easier send an e-mail 
          respectively. Lastly one person thought it would be a good idea to include information about how the buying
          and selling works to make it seem more legitimate and less like a scam.

      <h1>Our response:</h1>
      <p>
        Through the testing done by a handful of people we have gotten a lot of feedback, both positive and negative. 
        A lot of the "negative feedback" we recieved stems from the styling and design. None of the members present 
        in this team have any experience designing something to this extent, so 
        being told that we should try to follow the WCAG-convention would be of massive help if we were to continue 
        this after the project is due. The search functionality was talked about during the start of this project but 
        seeing as we are only allowed to use pure HTML, javascript and css this would prove to be a challenge. The 
        filter function was originally planned to be implemented, but again without the team being able to use XML 
        or json this would prove to be difficult, coupled with the deadline fast approaching would need to be cut. 
        The quality of life functionality could definetly be implemented as they do not require a lot of work and 
        helps provide a good user experience. Another user experienced some issue using the website on the phone, 
        which is due to more focus on getting the website to look good on desktop. This last point would probably 
        be the teams first priority in fixing as we wish that the user experience is smooth both on desktop and phone. 
        We are happy about the result and appreciated the feedback we got from the testing team.

      <h1>Self reflection</h1>
      <p>
        One of the big issues we stumbled upon in the start was how hectic the coding together would be. To begin with 
        we all worked on creating the menu and footer as this would be used for every website. To do this one person 
        hosted using live share and then everybody edit the same html and css document. In hindsight the team should 
        have divided the work so that some people work on menu in its own branch and another group work on footer in 
        another branch. This is something we did once we started working on the individual websites. For a lot of us 
        that hadn't used GitHub branches this was a very useful experience in understanding how to work on a single 
        coding project when in a larger group. Putting it all together was still hard, mostly due to inexperience 
        which led to us using a lot of time putting the website up to testing rather than time spent letting other people 
        test. Even though we couldn't do everything we had originally planned to do, we felt that we did a good job 
        in creating our first proper website.
